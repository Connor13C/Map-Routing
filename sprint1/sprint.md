# Sprint 1 - t08 - Pantz

## Goal

## A team effort to build a simple web application!

## Definition of Done

* Ready for demo / customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed.
* Product Increment release `v1.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the template, and a zip of the repo.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>1.0.0</version>`.
* Unit tests for all new features and public methods at a minimum.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.
* Clean continuous integration build/test on master branch.

## Policies

* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration always builds and tests successfully.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Daily Scrums

## Review

#### Completed user stories (epics) in Sprint Backlog 
* *Distance Calculator*: We created an application that takes in two coordinates and calculates the distance between them using the chord length formula.

#### Incomplete user stories / epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *Itinerary*: We are still working on the calculation of total distance when uploading a file of many coordinates (an itinerary). We currently have the button with a table. but the actual calculation is still in progress.

#### What went well
* So far we have a great team dynamic and are working well together. 
* We have also delegated tasks well according to our skill levels and have been able to complete things in a timely manner and start early on tasks.

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* Coordinating each others pieces of code and bringing them together was a little more challenging than we anticipated, but we were able to meet as a team and talk through how to bring it together. 

## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time |  | * This time we will make our tasks more sequential so changes are being integrated in the code in a more logical order versus just whenever they get finished by the person assigned to them. | 
What we did well | * We worked really well as a team, and have been getting a long really well.  |  | 
What we need to work on |  |  | *We are still working on getting familiar with the different tools such as zenhub and GitHub protocol as well as learning bootstrap and JavaScript
What we will change next time |  | * Next time we will be more organized in how we are going about splitting up epics more sequentially and assigning them based on that sequence.   |
