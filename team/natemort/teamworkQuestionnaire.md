# Teamwork Questionnaire for Nathanael Mortensen

1. __What is your personality type?__
   * INTJ
1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * It's easiest to reach me by text((970)402-8870), but I'm generally available by Slack. On weekend nights, Tuesdays, and Thursdays I'm generally unavailable
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I hope that we are able to successfully complete each sprint and receive a good grade
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I don't have as much experience working in teams on closely related components, and I'm very non-confrontational.  I hope to generally improve my communication and teamwork skills in this sort of environment.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I might personally struggle with not being assertive enough, and there may be members on my team that I simply cannot see eye to eye with.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * The people wanting to get an A will have to put in more work to make up for that.  I don't think it's possible to convince the members that are okay with getting a "B" to put in additional effort.  It's a harsh reality.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * Yes.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * 5-10 hours
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Weeekly group meetings where we collaboritvely assign roles based on individuals strengths.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * The team will come together to compensate as much as possible and the shortcoming will be mentioned on the sprint report.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * So long as it works, a compromise can be made.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Discussions to try and find a middle ground, as well as working around anything that can't be compromised.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think that more time will be necessary than the 15 minutes allotted in class, so I believe it will be necessary.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * We shouldn't need to meet more than once per week outside of class.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * I think approval of the majority of the team with an effort to include everyone in the decision making process is enough.  While ideally everyone approves, that may not be practical in all situations.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Compromise is a necessary, if unfortunate, team skill.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Talk with the individual first and bring up my concerns instead of confronting them in a group setting.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Attempt to gradually shift new responsibilities to other people.  If that isn't resolving it then I'll bring it up with individuals, then with the group.
