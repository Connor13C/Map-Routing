   * 7 hours a week for each individual group member.

   * The rest of the team will have to cover the slack and report the failure to the review process.

   * There is bound to be varying opinions but majority of group gets the say on the acceptablity of the quality.

1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Yes we have already decided to meet every friday.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * Once a week for sure, more if the assignment calls for it.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * Depends on the decision so as long it doesn't impact everything already agreed upon people should be able to make simple decisions on their own.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Take that person's opinion into account and see if a compromise can be made but the majority rule stands.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Depends on their capability, we already have a manager in the team structure so more leadership might be overkill. If it is a problem it will be addressed as a group.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * Honestly while it would stress me out, I've found being the lead in groups helps get all tasks accomplished so I wouldn't mind too much.
