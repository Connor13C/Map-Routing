What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
My expectations are that my team will accomplish all tasks in the course and have fun doing it.
What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
I want to learn to code in a team vs coding individually.
What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
If a team member decides not to put in the work it would be an issue.
What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
We would have to define what level of work is acceptable as a cohesive team.
Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
Yes.
How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
I would say around 4-5hrs/week.
How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
We will meet as a team before we start working on each assignment to delegate tasks.
What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
We will address that person individually and discuss what changes need to be made.
What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
We will define the parameters of what is expected before we work on each assignment so expectations are clear moving forward on each project.
How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
We will accomodate different working styles as long as the tasks move forward.
Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
Yes.
How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
Depending on the difficulty of the project, I would say 2-3 times/week.
Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
No.
What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
Majority rules.
What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
As long as everyone is okay with it, and everyone has assigned tasks, I am okay with it.
What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
Probably roll with it, and/or get another team member to help me out.
