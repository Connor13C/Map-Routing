1. What is your personality type?
	ISFJ
2. Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?
	Text, (720) 938-0590, I usually try to respond immediately, or slack as well.
3. What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?
	I expect my team to generally do well on each sprint. I think we all have different skills that we will bring to the table.
4. What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?
	Personally, I would just like to be able to communicate with my team members. I do have experience working on teams(student-athlete)
	but none like this. I hope to be a teammate my members can rely on to get the job done.
5. What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?
	I think I will struggle with someone not willing to put in the work. With issues like that I prefer to be the type to handle it head on.
6. What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?
	It will show who wants a good grade and who doesn't by the effort that each member on the team puts in. The way it is going to be graded will reflect
	it so I'm personally not super concerned.
7. Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?
	It depends, if someone has more experience in a certain area they will probably end up doing more work. That work may come in various forms e.g. coding
	or teaching different team members.
8. How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?
	Approximately 4-9 hours a week. 
9. How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?
	I think weekly group meetings, where we all talk about the assignment and what are the strengths and weaknesses of each member will help.
10. What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?
	Overall, the rest of the team will have to make up for that persons shortcomings, but it will be mentioned in the sprint reports. 
11. What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?
	No matter what a compromise will have to be made.
12. How will you deal with different work habits of team members?
	I think eventually there will have to be a discussion and compromise so that each team member will be able to work effectively and efficiently.
13. Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?
	Yes, that way we can make sure we are all on the same page.
14. How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?
	I think we would be good with meeting once a week outside of class to make sure everyone is one the same page.
15. Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?
	Generally, I think asking for the approval for every team member is necessary. Simiply, because certain decisions can affect work done by other 
	people.
16. What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?
	Compromise.
17. What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?
	It will have to be address individual at first. If it is still not resovled then a team meeting is needed then perhaps a meeting with the professor.
18. What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?
	I would have to bring it up with certain individuals I feel could take on more responsibilities.
