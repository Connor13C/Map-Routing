## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | We could be on time to meetings more.  |  We changed our rigidity in our meetings and with actively assigning tasks and just let each other pick up necessary tasks.| We created a lot of extra issues instead of closing the ones that were already open. 
What we did well |  We did well in our teamwork and in working well with one another. | We did well in merging pull requests in a timely manner | We did well on our sprint plan. 
What we need to work on |Our team work does not need to be worked on at all.   | We were very ambitious in what we thought we could accomplish this sprint with all of our other coursework so we need to be a little more realistic on what we can actually finish. | I think we have effectively used the tools this sprint.
What we will change next time |  nothing! Because we are finished with the course! |  |
