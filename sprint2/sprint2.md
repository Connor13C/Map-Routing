# Sprint 2 - *t08* - *Pantz*

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: *Connor Carey*

## Definition of Done

* Web application ready for demo and potential customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* ~~Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.~~

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *Build a responsive, mobile first web application*
* *Plan trips in the state of Colorado*
* *Let the user load a file with destinations*
* *Show an itinerary of the round trip*
* *Plan the trip in the destination order provided*
* *Let the user save their trip*
* *Give the user the option of miles or kilometers for the unit of distance*

*We will try to do more communication on the front end of the project instead of just communicating as we go. This time we will make our tasks more sequential so changes are being integrated in the code in a more logical order versus just whenever they get finished by the person assigned to them. We will hopefully be able to understand the tools better and be able to make changes faster. We will also be able to understand JavaScript a little more than we did last time. We did really well under our time constraints so if we keep up the pace like the last sprint we should have no problems*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *none!*


#### What went well
* *Everyone had pretty good teamwork and banded together to get tasks done*
* *All epics we set out to do were completed*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *Had to redo all task planned before the code was given to us, might have been more work then if we planned after*
* *Was hard to assign tasks, we decided it was better for everyone to pick a task and grab new ones when ready*
* *Start of the project we had idea how to implement code*
* *Uploaded a commit that broke a section on master and had to revert the changes*
## Retrospective

Topic | Teamwork | Process | Tools
:--- | :--- | :--- | :---
What we will change this time | We will incorporate Slack more into our communication. |Next time we will be more organized in how we are going about splitting up epics more sequentially and assigning them based on that sequence. | We will use ZenHub more as we go instead of updating it all at once.
What we did well | Good teamwork, communication, willingness help from everyone | Once we got started we cranked through tasks really quickly, pull requests were handled in timely manner | More usage of slack, implementing our old code successfully in the new system, and used ZenHub actively.
What we need to work on | Not too much at all maybe more communication between team member and class if we get stuck on a problem | We need to produce more tests when we submit a commit | Adding more tests to the entire project to ensure we have no bugs
What we will change next time | More communication with our fellow class members | We will be able to get started sooner because we understand the code now and have more incremental commits to let people see what they are working on | We will make more tests during the next sprint
