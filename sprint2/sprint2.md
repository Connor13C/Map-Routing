# Sprint 2 - *t08* - *Pantz*

## Goal

### A mobile, responsive map and itinerary!
### Sprint Leader: *Connor Carey*

## Definition of Done

* Web application ready for demo and potential customer release.
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v2.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>2.0.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* ~~Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.~~

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *Build a responsive, mobile first web application*
* *Plan trips in the state of Colorado*
* *Let the user load a file with destinations*
* *Show an itinerary of the round trip*
* *Plan the trip in the destination order provided*
* *Let the user save their trip*
* *Give the user the option of miles or kilometers for the unit of distance*

*We will try to do more communication on the front end of the project instead of just communicating as we go. This time we will make our tasks more sequential so changes are being integrated in the code in a more logical order versus just whenever they get finished by the person assigned to them. We will hopefully be able to understand the tools better and be able to make changes faster. We will also be able to understand JavaScript a little more than we did last time. We did really well under our time constraints so if we keep up the pace like the last sprint we should have no problems*
