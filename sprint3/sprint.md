# Sprint 3 - *t08* - *Pantz*

## Goal

### Shorter trips and more places to go!
### Sprint Leader: *Robbie Weinel*

## Definition of Done

* Web application deployed on the production server (kiwis.cs.colostate.edu).
* Sprint Review and Restrospectives completed (sprint.md).
* Product Increment release `v3.0` created on GitHub with appropriate version number and name, a description based on the Release Notes template, and the arhived files.
* Version in pom.xml should be `<version>3.0</version>`.
* Javadoc and unit tests for public methods.
* Coverage at least 50% overall and for each class.

## Policies

* Code adheres to Google style guides for Java and JavaScript.
* Tests and Javadoc are written before/with code.  
* All pull requests include tests for the added or modified code.
* Master is never broken.  If broken, it is fixed immediately.
* Always check for new changes in master to resolve merge conflicts locally before committing them.
* All changes are built and tested before they are committed.
* Continuous integration successfully builds and tests pull requests for master branch always.
* All commits with more than 1 line of change include a task/issue number.
* All Java dependencies in pom.xml.

## Plan

Epics planned for this release.

* *Give the user an option to view a shorter trip*
* *Clean Code*
* *Code Coverage*
* *Build a trip from Existing Information*
* *Design a trip from Scatch/manually*
* *Let the user choose a new starting location*
* *Give the user the option to choose what information to display in the itinerary*
* *Let the user save their trip*

*We decided to take on more epics than the last sprint because we were able to complete all of them on the last sprint and many of these epics go together so we decided to tackle all of them at once.

## Review

#### Completed epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *Give the user an option to view a shorter trip*:  *Done*
* *Clean Code*:  *As of last check codeclimate was an A*
* *Code Coverage*:  *We could increase it more, but we increased from low 10% to high 30%*
* *Build a trip from Existing Information*:  *Was done last sprint*
* *Design a trip from Scatch/manually*:  *Was done with a great UI*
* *Let the user choose a new starting location*:  *Added with drag and drop*
* *Let the user save their trip*: *Was done last sprint*

#### Incomplete epics in Sprint Backlog 
* *Give the user an option to choose what information to display in the itinerary*: *The other epics took longer than expected*

#### What went well
* *Our group communicated well and even with spring break finished almost all the epics we planned*
* *Our site looks amazing and functions just as good*

#### Problems encountered and resolutions
* *Spring break definetly got in the way of us finishing all our epics. Our solution was to work harder than planned when we came back from it.*
* *There were typical computer science problems encountered, like the spread opperator not functioning. To solve this we used our combined knowledge to find a work around.*
